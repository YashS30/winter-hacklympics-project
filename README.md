# Winter Hacklympics Project

## Getting started

To run the app yourself you only need Python installed. Download the repository to your computer and create a Python virtual environment in the project folder. Then run the command

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Now all you need to do is run

```
$ python3 app.py
```

and you're done! The development server will be started and all you need to do is follow the link it gives you.
